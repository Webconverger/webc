# LOCALIZATION NOTE FOR `jsPropertyTitle` AND `jsPropertyInspectTitle`:
#
# The "PropertyPanel" is used to display a JS object to the user.
# If it is clear which object is being inspected (e.g., window, document object)
# the title of the panel is based on the `jsPropertyInspectTitle` string.
# If it isn't clear which object is being inspected, the `jsPropertyTitle` string
# gets used. This can be the case when the user logs an object to the WebConsole
# output using the console.log(aObjectToInspect) method.
#
# You can find a screenshot of the PropertyPanel here:
#   https://bug585030.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=464034
jsPropertyTitle=객체 검사기
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (jsPropertyInspectTitle):
#
# The %S is replaced by the evaluated code the user clicked on in the console.
#
# Example: The user executed `window.document` in the WebConsole. The `document`
# object is written to the output. If the user clicks on the `document` output
# in the console, a PropertyPanel will show up. The title of the PropertyPanel
# is set to `Inspect: window.document` because the clicked `document` object was
# evaluated based on the `window.document` string.
jsPropertyInspectTitle=검사: %S
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (timestampFormat): %1$02S = hours (24-hour clock),
# %2$02S = minutes, %3$02S = seconds, %4$03S = milliseconds.
