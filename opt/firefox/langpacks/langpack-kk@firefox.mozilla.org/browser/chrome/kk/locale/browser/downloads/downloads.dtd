<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (downloadDetails.width):
      Width of details for a Downloads Panel item (which directly influences the
      width of the Downloads Panel) expressed using a CSS unit. The longest
      labels that should fit in the item width are usually those of in-progress
      downloads and those of blocked downloads.
 
      A good rule of thumb is to try to determine the longest string possible
      that an in-progress download could display, and use that value in ch
      units.
 
      For example, in English, a long string would be:
 
      59 minutes, 59 seconds remaining - 1022 of 1023 KB
 
      That's 50 characters, so we set the width at 50ch.
      -->
<!ENTITY downloadDetails.width            "50ch">
 
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (downloadsSummary.minWidth):
      Minimum width for the main description of the downloads summary,
      which is displayed at the bottom of the Downloads Panel if the
      number of downloads exceeds the limit that the panel can display.
 
      A good rule of thumb here is to look at the otherDownloads string
      in downloads.properties, and make a reasonable estimate of its
      maximum length. For English, this seems like a reasonable limit:
 
      +999 other current downloads
 
      that's 28 characters, so we set the minimum width to 28ch.
      -->
<!ENTITY downloadsSummary.minWidth        "28ch">

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (downloadsHistory.label, downloadsHistory.accesskey):
      This string is shown at the bottom of the Downloads Panel when all the
      downloads fit in the available space, or when there are no downloads in
      the panel at all.

     A good rule of thumb here is to look at the otherDownloads2 string
     in downloads.properties, and make a reasonable estimate of its
     maximum length. For English, this seems like a reasonable limit:

     + 999 other downloads

     that's 21 characters, so we set the minimum width to 21ch.
