'And so at last the beast <em class="f">fell</em> and the unbelievers rejoiced.
But all was not lost, for from the ash rose a <em>great bird</em>.
The bird gazed down upon the unbelievers and cast <em class="f">fire</em>
and <em>thunder</em> upon them. For the beast had been
<em>reborn</em> with its strength <em>renewed</em>, and the
followers of <em>Mammon</em> cowered in horror.'>

'The <em>twins</em> of Mammon quarrelled. Their warring plunged the world into a <em>new darkness</em>, and the beast 
abhorred the darkness. So it began to move <em>swiftly</em>, and grew more powerful, and went forth and multiplied. 
And the beasts brought <em>fire</em> and light to the darkness.'>
