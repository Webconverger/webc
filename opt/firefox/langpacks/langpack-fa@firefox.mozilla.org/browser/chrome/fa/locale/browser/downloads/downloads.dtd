<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (downloadDetails.width):
     Width of details for a Downloads Panel item (which directly influences the
     width of the Downloads Panel) expressed using a CSS unit. The longest
     labels that should fit in the item width are usually those of in-progress
     downloads and those of blocked downloads.

     A good rule of thumb is to try to determine the longest string possible
     that an in-progress download could display, and use that value in ch
     units.

     For example, in English, a long string would be:

     59 minutes, 59 seconds remaining - 1022 of 1023 KB

     That's 50 characters, so we set the width at 50ch.
     -->
<!ENTITY downloadDetails.width            "50ch">
<!ENTITY downloadsHistory.accesskey       "S">

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (downloadsHistory.label, downloadsHistory.accesskey):
     This string is shown at the bottom of the Downloads Panel when all the
     downloads fit in the available space, or when there are no downloads in
     the panel at all.
     -->
<!ENTITY downloadsHistory.label           "Show All Downloads">

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (downloadsListEmpty.label):
     This string is shown when there are no items in the Downloads view, when it
     is displayed inside a browser tab.
     -->
<!ENTITY downloadsListEmpty.label         "There are no downloads.">

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (downloadsListNoMatch.label):
     This string is shown when some search terms are specified, but there are no
     results in the Downloads view.
     -->
<!ENTITY downloadsListNoMatch.label       "Could not find any matching downloads.">

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (downloadsPanelEmpty.label):
     This string is shown when there are no items in the Downloads Panel.
     -->
<!ENTITY downloadsPanelEmpty.label        "No downloads for this session.">

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (downloadsSummary.minWidth2):
     Minimum width for the main description of the downloads summary,
     which is displayed at the bottom of the Downloads Panel if the
     number of downloads exceeds the limit that the panel can display.

     A good rule of thumb here is to look at the otherDownloads2 string
     in downloads.properties, and make a reasonable estimate of its
     maximum length. For English, this seems like a reasonable limit:

     + 999 other downloads

     that's 21 characters, so we set the minimum width to 21ch.
     -->
<!ENTITY downloadsSummary.minWidth2       "21ch">

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (learnMore.label):
     Shown as a text link for some types of blocked downloads, for example
     malware, when there is an associated explanation page on the Mozilla site.
     Note: This string doesn't exist in the UI yet.  See bug 1053890.
