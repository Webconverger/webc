<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (downloads.title):
     Used by screen readers to describe the Downloads Panel.
     -->
<!ENTITY downloads.title "Stahování">

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (downloadDetails.width):
     Width of details for a Downloads Panel item (which directly influences the
     width of the Downloads Panel) expressed using a CSS unit. The longest
     labels that should fit in the item width are usually those of in-progress
     downloads and those of blocked downloads.

     A good rule of thumb is to try to determine the longest string possible
     that an in-progress download could display, and use that value in ch
     units.

     For example, in English, a long string would be:

     59 minutes, 59 seconds remaining - 1022 of 1023 KB

     That's 50 characters, so we set the width at 50ch.
     -->
<!ENTITY downloadDetails.width "50ch">

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (downloadsSummary.minWidth):
     Minimum width for the main description of the downloads summary,
     which is displayed at the bottom of the Downloads Panel if the
     number of downloads exceeds the limit that the panel can display.

     A good rule of thumb here is to look at the otherDownloads string
     in downloads.properties, and make a reasonable estimate of its
     maximum length. For English, this seems like a reasonable limit:

     +999 other current downloads

     that's 28 characters, so we set the minimum width to 28ch.
