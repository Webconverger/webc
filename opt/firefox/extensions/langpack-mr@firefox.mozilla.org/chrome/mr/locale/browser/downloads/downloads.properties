# LOCALIZATION NOTE (statusSeparator, statusSeparatorBeforeNumber):

# "Canceled - 222.net", "1.1 MB - website2.com", or "Paused -  1.1 MB".  Note
# that we use a wider space after the separator when it is followed by a number,
# just to avoid visually confusing it with with a minus sign with some fonts.
# If you use a different separator, this might not be necessary.  However, there
# is usually no need to change the separator or the order of the substitutions,
# even for right-to-left languages, unless the defaults are not suitable.
