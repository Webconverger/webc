 system. The mounting of the real root file system occurs in early user space.
 klibc provides utilities to setup root. Having the root on MD, LVM2, LUKS or
 NFS is also supported.
 Any boot loader with initrd support is able to load an initramfs archive.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Description: The Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

 hashing and works similarly to the standard UNIX 'dbm' functions.
 .
 The basic use of 'gdbm' is to store key/data pairs in a data file, thus
 providing a persistent version of the 'dictionary' Abstract Data Type
 ('hash' to perl programmers).

Description: Update Configuration File: preserve user changes to config files.
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.

Description: ALSA wrapper for OSS applications
 This package contains a program loader, aoss, which wraps
 applications written for OSS in a compatibility library,
 thus allowing them to work with ALSA.
 .
 There are two ways of getting an application to work with
 ALSA if the application was written for OSS. The first way
 is to load the special ALSA drivers that emulate the OSS
 kernel interface; these allow the application to open
 /dev/dsp0 and other OSS device files. The second way is
 to wrap the application in the libaoss library provided
 in this package; the wrapper causes the application to
 access native ALSA device files such as /dev/snd/pcmC0D0c
 instead of OSS device files.
 .
 Use of the alsa-oss library is recommended over the use of
 OSS-emulation drivers if you want to use ALSA's PCM plugin
 layer.
 .
 ALSA is the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture:

 OpenChrome is a project for the development of free and open-source drivers

 Originally called the 'snapshot' release, since it was a snapshot of an

 of the open source unichrome driver (from http://unichrome.sf.net) which
 also incorporates support for the unichrome-pro chipsets.
 .
 Support for hardware acceleration (XvMC) for all chipsets has subsequently
 been ripped out of the unichrome.sf.net driver. Therefore your only option if
 you wish to make use of the acceleration features of your VIA chip with free
 and open-source drivers is to use this version of the driver.

 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
 It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
 as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
 on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.

Description: SMBIOS/DMI table decoder
 Dmidecode reports information about the system's hardware as described in the
 system BIOS according to the SMBIOS/DMI standard.
 .
 This information typically includes system manufacturer, model name, serial
 number, BIOS version, asset tag as well as a lot of other details of varying
 level of interest and reliability depending on the manufacturer. This will
 often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI,
 ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel,
 USB).
 .
 Beware that DMI data have proven to be too unreliable to be blindly trusted.
 Dmidecode does not scan the hardware, it only reports what the BIOS told it to.

Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from

 libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension
 libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions
 and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the
 libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of
 the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.

 there is no need to duplicate or change the keyboard files just to
 make simple customizations such as the use of dead keys, the key
 functioning as AltGr or Compose key, the key(s) to switch between
 Latin and non-Latin mode, etc.
 .
 The package also contains console fonts supporting many of the
 world's languages.  It provides an unified set of font faces - the
 classic VGA, the simplistic Fixed, and the cleaned Terminus,
 TerminusBold and TerminusBoldVGA.

  * Double-Button events through double short touching of the touchpad
  * Dragging through short touching and holding down the finger on the touchpad
  * Middle and right button events on the upper and lower corner of the touchpad
  * Vertical scrolling (button four and five events) through moving the finger
    on the right side of the touchpad
  * The up/down button sends button four/five events
  * Horizontal scrolling (button six and seven events) through moving the finger
    on the lower side of the touchpad
  * The multi-buttons send button four/five events, and six/seven events for
    horizontal scrolling
  * Adjustable finger detection
  * Multifinger taps: two finger for middle button and three finger for right
    button events. (Needs hardware support. Not all models implement this
    feature.)
  * Run-time configuration using shared memory. This means you can change
    parameter settings without restarting the X server (see synclient(1)).
  * It also provides a daemon to disable touchpad while typing at the keyboard
    and thus avoid unwanted mouse movements (see syndaemon(1)).

Description: dynamic window manager
 dwm is a minimalistic window manager. It manages windows in tiling and floating
 modes. Either mode can be applied dynamically, depending on the application in
 use and the task performed.
 .
 In tiling mode windows are managed in a master and stacking column. The master
 column contains the window which needs most attention at a time, whereas the
 stacking column contains all other windows in a stack. Dialog windows are
 managed floating, however.
 .
 In floating mode windows can be resized and moved freely. Windows are grouped
 by tags. All windows with a specific tag can be viewed at a time. But each
 window may contain more than one tag, which makes it visible in several views.
 .
 Please notice that dwm is currently customized through editing its source code,
 so you probably want to build your own dwm packages. This package is compiled
 with the default configuration and should just give you an idea about what dwm
 brings to your desktop.

Description: X C Binding, dri2 extension
 This package contains the library files needed to run software using
 libxcb-dri2, the dri2 extension for the X C Binding.
 .
 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: X C Binding, render extension
 This package contains the library files needed to run software using
 libxcb-render, the render extension for the X C Binding.
 .
 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: scalable fonts for X
 xfonts-scalable provides fonts that can be drawn at any size by the X server
 or font server without loss of quality.  In most cases it is desirable to
 have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server installed to make the fonts
 available to X clients.
 .
 This package is missing three fonts from the X.Org source archives
 because the license terms on the fonts do not meet the Debian Free
 Software Guidelines; they are the Type1 fonts Adobe Utopia, IBM Courier,
 and Bigelow & Holmes (B&H) Luxi.
 .

 for use by an X server or X font server.

 xfonts-100dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 100 dots per inch.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains only fonts in the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1
 encodings, to conserve disk space.  For other encodings, see the
 xfonts-100dpi-transcoded package.
 .
 This package and xfonts-75dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-100dpi may be more suitable for large monitors and/or
 large screen resolutions (over 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xfonts-utils package to prepare the font
 directories for use by an X server or X font server.

Description: MIT Kerberos runtime libraries - Support library
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
 .
 This package contains an internal runtime support library used by other
 Kerberos libraries.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web
 using http(s) and ftp, the two most widely used Internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp
 sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp
 retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: X11 utilities
 An X client is a program that interfaces with an X server (almost always via
 the X libraries), and thus with some input and output hardware like a
 graphics card, monitor, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse).
 .
 This package provides a miscellaneous assortment of X utilities
 that ship with the X Window System, including:
  - appres, editres, listres and viewres, which query the X resource database;
  - luit, a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
    UTF-8 terminal emulator;
  - xdpyinfo, a display information utility for X;
  - xdriinfo, query configuration information of DRI drivers;
  - xev, an X event displayer;
  - xfd, a tool that displays all the glyphs in a given X font;
  - xfontsel, a tool for browsing and selecting X fonts;
  - xkill, a tool for terminating misbehaving X clients;
  - xlsatoms, which lists interned atoms defined on an X server;
  - xlsclients, which lists client applications running on an X display;
  - xlsfonts, a server font list displayer;
  - xmessage, a tool to display message or dialog boxes;
  - xprop, a property displayer for X;
  - xvinfo, an Xv extension information utility for X;
  - xwininfo, a window information utility for X;
 .
 The editres and viewres programs use bitmap images provided by the
 xbitmaps package. The luit program requires locale information from
 the libx11-data package.

Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC2440.
 .
 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to
 the version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes
 with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop
 environments, but also with less dependencies.
 .
 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support
 HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use
 the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.
 .
 GnuPG does not use any patented algorithms. This means it cannot be
 compatible with PGP2, because that uses IDEA (which is patented in
 a number of countries).

Description: X Window System (X.Org) infrastructure
 x11-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration; it does not
 provide a full installation of clients, servers, libraries, and utilities
 required to run the X Window System.
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X",
 "X Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R7".  The version of X used in
 Debian is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and
 is thus often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted
 terms are functionally interchangeable in an Debian system.

 .
 inotifywait simply blocks for inotify events, making it appropriate
 for use in shell scripts.
 .
 inotifywatch collects filesystem usage statistics and outputs counts
 of each inotify event.

Description: Advanced Configuration and Power Interface event daemon
 Modern computers support the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)
 to allow intelligent power management on your system and to query battery and
 configuration status.
 .
 ACPID is a completely flexible, totally extensible daemon for delivering
 ACPI events. It listens on netlink interface (or on the deprecated file
 /proc/acpi/event), and when an event occurs, executes programs to handle the
 event. The programs it executes are configured through a set of configuration
 files, which can be dropped into place by packages or by the admin.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 .
 IJS is a client-server protocol, used to write ghostscript drivers. The
 drivers are separate programs. The client and server communicate via pipes,
 though shared memory may be used additionally in the future. Currently IJS
 is used by the hpijs and ijsgimpprint drivers.
 .
 Code for both the client- and server-side is included in the library. This

Description: Cyrus SASL - authentication abstraction library
 This is the Cyrus SASL API implementation, version 2.1.
 .
 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
 adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
 SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
 authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating
 protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is
 negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the
 connection. See RFC 2222 for more information.
 .
 Any of: ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI (MIT or Heimdal
 Kerberos 5), NTLM, OTP, PLAIN, or LOGIN can be used. If you intend to
 use this package on a server that provides SASL authentication, then
 you must install some of the libsasl2-modules* packages.

 xfonts-75dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 75 dots per inch.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains only fonts in the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1
 encodings, to conserve disk space.  For other encodings, see the
 xfonts-75dpi-transcoded package.
 .
 This package and xfonts-100dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-75dpi may be more suitable for small monitors and/or
 small screen resolutions (under 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xfonts-utils package to prepare the font
 directories for use by an X server or X font server.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: Tool to organize boot sequence using LSB init.d script dependencies
 The insserv program is used to update the order of symlinks in
 /etc/rc?.d/ with sysv-rc based on dependencies specified in the
 scripts themselves using LSB init.d script headers.
 .
 This allow each package maintainer to specify their init.d script
 relation to other scripts and make it possible to detect and reject
 script dependency loops as well as making sure all scripts start in
 their intended order.
 .
 The program insserv in this package should be used with care and
 together with the sysv-rc package, as using it incorrectly can lead
 to an unbootable system.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM

Description: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This package provides the git main components with minimal dependencies.
 Additional functionality, e.g. a graphical user interface and revision
 tree visualizer, tools for interoperating with other VCS's, or a web
 interface, is provided as separate git* packages.

Description: process scheduling daemon
 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do some basic daily system
 maintenance tasks, such as creating backups of key system files. Other
 packages, such as checksecurity, can provide further maintenance tasks.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is recommended as it will prevent
 /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple
 times if something gets jammed.

 This package provides the shared libraries for Security-enhanced
 Linux that provides interfaces (e.g. library functions for the
 SELinux kernel APIs like getcon(), other support functions like
 getseuserbyname()) to SELinux-aware applications. Security-enhanced
 Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
 enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
 controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
 architectural components originally developed to improve the security
 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

Description: client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match
 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the
 long run.  ntpdate by itself is useful for occasionally setting the
 time on machines that do not have full-time network access, such as
 laptops.
 .
 If the full NTP daemon from the package "ntp" is installed, then
 ntpdate is not necessary.

Description: Debian Font Manager -- automatic font configuration framework
 Defoma, which stands for DEbian FOnt MAnager, provides a framework
 for automatic font configuration. An application whose configuration
 of fonts usually requires manual intervention can automate the
 process through Defoma, by installing a Defoma-configuration
 script. The script gets called whenever a font is installed and
 removed, so that the script may update the application configuration.
 .
 Font packages should register their fonts to Defoma in order to have them
 configured automatically for applications.

 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.

Description: a macro processing language
 GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
 processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
 extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
 macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
 shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for
 generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.

 symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities
 can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,
 busybox-udhcpc or busybox-udhcpd packages.

Description: ISC DHCP client
 This is the client from the Internet Software Consortium's implementation of
 DHCP. For more information visit http://www.isc.org.
 .
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like BOOTP
 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.
 .
 Extra documentation can be found in the package isc-dhcp-common.
