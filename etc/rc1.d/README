The scripts in this directory are executed each time the system enters
this runlevel.

The scripts are all symbolic links whose targets are located in
/etc/init.d/ .

Generally it is not necessary to alter the scripts in this directory.
Their purpose is to stop all services and thus to put the system in
single-user mode.

For more information see /etc/init.d/README.
