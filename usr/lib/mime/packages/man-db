# priority=6 above the default 5 on the basis that viewing a man page
# with man is above average sensible.
#
# Priority above /usr/lib/mime/packages/groff-base "nroff -mandoc"
# since "man" has the advantage of running preprocessors such as tbl
# specified in the man page and so gives better results.  Eg on
# /usr/share/man/man1/gtbl.1.gz (the tbl man page uses tbl).  Locale
# charset handling in man is probably better too.
#
# "man -X" is only priority=6 since the gxditview it runs is rather
# basic and perhaps something more sophisticated could be higher.  The
# X entry is before the tty so the X is preferred under X.  (The tty
# one still works there, in its declared needsterminal.)
#
# "-X100" seems to make better output than the default -X 75 dpi.
# Dunno if that's some font dodginess or matching the X server's
# advertised screen size resolution or something.
#
# "test -e gxditview" because it's in the "groff" package which is
# only a Suggests of man-db and so may not be available.
