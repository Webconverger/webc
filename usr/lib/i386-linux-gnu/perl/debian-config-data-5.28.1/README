These config.sh.* files are generated during the package build
and installed into the libperl5.xx package, in the directory
/usr/lib/<triplet>/perl/config-data-<version>. They contain probed values
about system configuration, used for cross building the package.

The probes currently need to run on the native architecture, so they
cannot be used for cross building. As a workaround, we store the results
in the built binary package and then manually copy them back to the
source package as needed.

The process is currently experimental, and no commitment is made on long
term feasibility of this. We will see how it goes.
