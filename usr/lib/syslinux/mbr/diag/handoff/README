Diagnostic MBR/VBR files

handoff.bin	Show the data that the BIOS/MBR hands off to an MBR/VBR.


  +++ USAGE +++

NOTE: in the examples, mbr.bin, /dev/hda and /dev/hda1 are used as generic representations.

Writing out an MBR is straight forward (it is assumed below that /dev/hda is the target raw device and /dev/hda1 is the target partition):

  dd conv=notrunc bs=440 count=1 if=mbr.bin of=/dev/hda

Writing a VBR to match Syslinux requires more work as it must have a jump and be offset into the partition (and as a result the code must be compatible with this offset):

  echo -en "\0353\0130\0220" |dd conv=notrunc bs=1 count=3 of=/dev/hda1
  dd conv=notrunc bs=2 count=210 seek=45 if=mbr.bin of=/dev/hda1
