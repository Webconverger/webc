######################## Debian wpa-roam Template #############################
#
# Template configuration for wpa-roam mode of Debian's wpasupplicant package.
# wpa-roam mode is described in detail in the wpa_action(8) manpage, and also
# at /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/README.modes.gz. Please read these documents
# to get an overview of how to setup this mode.
#
# For a detailed set of configuration examples for different networks, refer to
# /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/README.wpa_supplicant.conf.gz
#
# Also see the other files in /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/examples/ for
# specific network configuration examples.
#
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored
#
# NOTE! This file may contain password information and should be made readable
# only by root user or netdev group on multiuser systems.
#
######################## Global Configuration Options #########################
#
# The update_config option can be used to allow wpa_supplicant to overwrite
# configuration file whenever configuration is changed (e.g., new network block
# is added with wpa_cli or wpa_gui, or a password is changed). This is required
# for wpa_cli/wpa_gui to be able to store the configuration changes
# permanently.
#
# NOTE! Any comments will be removed from the configuration file when the
# update_config option is used.
#
#update_config=1

# The ctrl_interface specifies the path to a unix socket through which the
# supplicant may be controlled and interacted with.
#
# DIR=   Path to UNIX socket control interface, mandatory for wpa-roam mode
# GROUP= Users in this group to control wpa_supplicant via wpa_cli/wpa_gui
#
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
#
######################## Network Block Configurations #########################
#
# Each network is configured as a separate block in this configuration file.
# The network blocks are listed in preference of order, the top most network
# to be found in scan results is used.
#
# By default, all networks will get same priority (0). If some of the networks
# are more desirable, the "priority=" network parameter can be used to change
# the order in which wpa_supplicant goes through the network blocks when
# selecting what network will be used. The priority groups will be iterated
# in decreasing priority, the network with the highest priority value will be
# considered for selection first and the network with the lowest priority value
# will be considered last.
#
# NOTE! The scan_ssid=1 and ap_scan=2 modes ignore the priority field. Instead,
# the networks will be considered in the order specified in this configuration
# file.
#
# The "id_str=" network identifier string parameter is given to wpa_action when
# a network has been selected, and contains this field in its configuration
# block. The given id_str string will be used to select a logical interfaces
# from ifupdown's /etc/network/interfaces file.
