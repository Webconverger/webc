- add a note taking about the move to /etc/console/

- debconf stuff in rough priority order:
 + handle removal of keymaps
 + handle package removal

 + support local templates.in and config.in files.  Need to think hard
   about how to merge config files

 + fix "defaults" problem if any
 + put "missing default" warnings in debconf questions - maybe use different template ?

 + factorize declare_*

 + switch to M4 for file generation

 + abstract some more the configure() proc to allow reuse.
 + handle fonts, fallbacks, maybe ACMs.
 + add per-keymap priority, to ease choice for newcommers.
 + fine-grained analysis to decide whether going through config again
   when keymaps are added or changed.
 + detect serial-console machines and do nothing then ?
 + propose several policies for whether to reconfigure when new data
   files are introduced: always, never, new-choices - add note when
   going through reconfig because of new keymaps.

- other:
 + cleanup of old cruft in kbd and console-tools
 + remove the Conflicts: console-data (<< 1999.08.29-20) when enough
   time will have passed.

 + i18n of install-keymap
