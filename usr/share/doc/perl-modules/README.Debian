This package contains those Perl core modules that are architecture
independent. See /usr/share/doc/perl/README.Debian for more information
on the Perl Debian packaging.

Please note that this package only exists to save archive space and
should be considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl'
package. Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules' directly,
they should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules') instead.
See Debian bug #552052 for background.
