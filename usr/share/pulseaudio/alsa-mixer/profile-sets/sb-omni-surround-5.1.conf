; Creative Sound Blaster Omni Surround 5.1
;
; This sound card have Mic/Line in at hw:%f,1,0 on Linux prior to 4.3-rc1,
; but starting from Linux 4.3-rc1 Mic/Line is at hw:%f,0,0
; This config supports both cases.
; Also by default there are some non-existing (physically) inputs
; and outputs that are not present here.
; And finally officially supported modes are stereo and 5.1 + stereo S/PDIF,
; so only these modes included.
;
; See default.conf for an explanation on the directives used here.
