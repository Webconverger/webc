; Common part of all paths

; So here's generally how mixer paths are used by PA: PA goes through
; a mixer path file from top to bottom and checks if a mixer element
; described therein exists. If so it is added to the list of mixer
; elements PA will control, keeping the order it read them in. If a
; mixer element described here has set the required= or
; required-absent= directives a path might not be accepted as valid
; and is ignored in its entirety (see below). However usually if a
; element listed here is missing this one element is ignored but not
; the entire path.
;
; When a device shall be muted/unmuted *all* elements listed in a path
; file with "switch = mute" will be toggled.
;
; When a device shall change its volume, PA will got through the list
; of all elements with "volume = merge" and set the volume on the
; first element. If that element does not support dB volumes, this is
; where the story ends. If it does support dB volumes, PA divides the
; requested volume by the volume that was set on this element, and
; then go on to the next element with "volume = merge" and then set
; that there, and so on.  That way the first volume element in the
; path will be the one that does the 'biggest' part of the overall
; volume adjustment, with the remaining elements usually being set to
; some value next to 0dB. This logic makes sure we get the full range
; over all volume sliders and a very high granularity of volumes
; already in hardware.
;
; All switches and enumerations set to "select" are exposed via the
; "port" functionality of sinks/sources. Basically every possible
; switch setting and every possible enumeration setting will be
; combined and made into a "port". So make sure you don't list too
; many switches/enums for exposing, because the number of ports might
; rise exponentially.
;
; Only one path can be selected at a time. All paths that are valid
; for an audio device will be exposed as "port" for the sink/source.
