; Steelseries Arctis 7 USB headset stereo output path. Works also with Arctis
; Pro Wireless. The headset has two output devices. The first one is mono,
; meant for voice audio, and the second one is stereo, meant for everything
; else. The purpose of this unusual design is to provide separate volume
; controls for voice and other audio, which can be useful in gaming.
;
; This path doesn't provide hardware volume control, because the stereo
; output is controlled by the PCM element with index 1, and currently
; PulseAudio only supports elements with index 0.
