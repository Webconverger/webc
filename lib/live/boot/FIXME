Note
----

live-boot is moving from a monolithic script into a proper
plugin architecture for better maintenance and customization.

Additionally, this will allow us to abstract initramfs-tools
integration to also support other initrd generators, such as
dracut.

Unfortunately, from a developers point of view, we could no
finish this in time for wheezy, but we will finish this for
jessie. Please excuse the sorry state of the 9990-* scripts.
From a users point of view, it doesn't matter at all though.


Scripts overview
